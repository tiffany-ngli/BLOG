**Author:** Blake Crouch

**Genre:** Science Fiction, Fiction, Thriller, Time Travel, Mystery

**Rating:** ⭐️⭐️⭐

I had high expectations starting this book, having heard many say this is a 5-star read. However, it fell short for me, and here's why. From the first page, it was clear this book is a page-turner. Blake Crouch does a phenomenal job setting up a suspenseful scene that keeps readers on their toes as Barry unveils more about the mysterious False Memory Syndrome (FMS) that has slowly plagued New York City. On the flip side, Helena's perspective narrates her progression with mapping and retrieving memories in hopes of aiding her mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. By teaming up with Slade, Helena managed to bring her vision to life, building the memory chair. Although she accomplished her dream and reached a scientific feat, it quickly turned into her worst nightmare, nearly causing the end of the world. 

Crouch uses the perfect balance of scientific jargon for science lovers and your average reader, enough to paint the story without getting lost in the facts. I found myself in the middle of this scale, being able to follow, but not an expert at identifying plot holes. Out of curiosity, I tried to circle back new discoveries to previous events to make sense of the whole time-traveling occurrence that was causing FMS. This book is worth reading for all die-hard science and time travel lovers. However, as much of a science girlie I am, this book was simply not for me. It's an easy book to pick up, but hard to finish. Once I reached the end, I found myself reading with the intention to finish the book rather than out of enjoyment.

The repetition of the 30 year time loop lost my interest with vaguer story lines each time the loop occurs with minimal progress towards resolving the issue became mundane to read.
