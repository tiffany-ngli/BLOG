This book single-handedly got me out of my reading rut. I purchased it in my junior year of college on a Target run with my roommates, but didn’t come around to reading it until my first year of grad school. Two unexpected things happened since then: I finished the book, and I started grad school. Looking back at the past four years, a lot of things have changed that I didn’t foresee. Although I’ve seen just as much change occur in the past few months, that has led me to realize – you truly never know where life takes you. One thing that remained constant was my long-lasting friendships – having lived with the same set of roommates for all four years of college, one of them whom I met in the sixth grade.

*A Little Life* is not your typical story following four lifelong friends and their walk in life. It’s much more complex with dark secrets, which piques readers’ interest in Jude as they know just as little as his best friends: Willem, Malcom, and JB. Peering into their lives, seeing them accomplish their dreams, helps build the connection between the readers and characters. However, Jude’s story was the most impactful on me. Somehow, the people who know him best, in fact, knew nothing about him at all. Even so, with the little amount they knew, the rest of the bunch never stopped caring to know and nurturing him to accept the love he thought he never deserved.

The consensus on whether this book is worth reading, I think it’s worth it. Hanya Yanagihara is a great storyteller. There were parts of the book that wavered my attention, but she never failed to reel me back in. For such a long book, it does a good job of retention and building an attachment to the characters.

  One of the reasons why I felt my attention waver was the repetitiveness of Jude's nature. Although I understand it's meant to depict the severe condition in its truest forms and how his hardships have taken a toll on him, time and time again, reading the dark state Jude was stuck in, inadvertently made my empathy diminish as he refused to let others in. Obviously, easier said than done in real life, but in the story, it was reiterated several times that it was unnecessary to repeat it to get the point across. It would be a cycle of good things happening to him, taking a healthy step forward, only to be thrown 10 steps back. For instance, when Harry and Juliet adopted Jude, finally allowing him to experience a loving household, only to have him get entangled with Caleb, who made him relive his abuse mentally and physically.
  
  I remember reading up to the part when Willem realized he had feelings for Jude. Although I enjoyed the outcome, I wished more hints were given throughout the book from any of the characters' points of view. The lack of buildup made it seem abrupt and thrown in the mix of Jude's life. It was hard to differentiate whether Willem was simply being a good friend or if he had been interested all along. I wish more were shared about their initial stages of interest.
